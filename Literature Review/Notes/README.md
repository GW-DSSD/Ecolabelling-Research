# Please use the file notes_template to take any and all notes on a given paper

## Please include relevant information to our project, including direct quotations with page numbers. This will greatly help with writing the paper.

Please upload your one-pager once you have completed a reading. Turn the Word document into a PDF, then name the file by your last name and the article name. For example, if I am reading a paper called "The ecolabeling world" I would name my PDF file "Martin_The ecolabeling world"
