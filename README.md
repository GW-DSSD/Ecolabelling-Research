# Spring-2023-Research
Spring 2023 Research Repo for the GW DSSD Hub Team

## Welcome to the official Git repo for the GW Data Science for Sustainable Development Hub's first research project

Data Science for Sustainable Development (DSSD) is a 501(c)3 certified nonprofit. We are committed to providing technical services to nonprofits, government agencies, and companies working in development and social impact with limited technological resources and capacity. We aim to foster innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration, open-source technical knowledge, and the desire to provide solutions to humanitarian and development practitioners.

Pursuing research is an opportunity for us to contribute ideas and solutions to some of the planet's greatest threats. Although DSSD is primarily a consulting hub, producing our own research allows us bridge the gap between the academic and the data science communities.

All work on this project should be completed through this repo for sourch code management purposes.
